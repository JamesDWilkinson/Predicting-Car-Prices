# Predicting Car Prices
 Using K-Nearest Neighbors Machine Learning algorithms to predict the prices of cars

In this project, I learned how to make code to train, test, and evaluate data somewhat from scratch (excluding the scikit learn object methods for fitting and predicting the KNN model). I can then analyze the evaluations of the function over multiple varying parameters by creating a pandas dataframe out of itertools products and list comprehensions. Finally, this data can be visualized using pyplot.

Further exploration of this project might result in adapting code I've written for Folding techniques into the functions and writing a function that performs data cleaning on pandas dataframes.
